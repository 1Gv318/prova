The most simple way to update your blog is to simply push changes to the production branch. However, at time you might want to preview your changes before it goes live. To preview a change, make a Pull Request (PR). Every PR is deployed in a preview environment that you can access from your dashboard. Every merge to the production branch (main or master) makes your changes go live.
