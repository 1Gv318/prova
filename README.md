# Sample blog powered by [Truegit](https://truegit.io)

1. Create a Github repository with a truegit.yaml configuration file at the root folder. You may also fork this sample repository to get started.
2. Install the [Github App](https://github.com/apps/truegit-app) and give it access to the repository.
3. Log in to Truegit dashboard and add the repository. At this point, your blog should be live.
4. Push a change to your repository to see the changes, or make a Pull Request to preview new changes.

## Add a new post

To add a new post, simple add a new markdown file to the repository.

For more information, read the [Documentation](https://docs.truegit.io).
